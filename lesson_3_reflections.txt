When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It is so because git log and git status works offline, so if you are going to be offline for a long period of time, 
this would help in knowing the latest changes that have been stored at the remote by other people.
